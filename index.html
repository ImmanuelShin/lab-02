            <h2>Biography</h2></h1>
            <p>I was born in Federal Way, Washington, as a 2nd generation Korean American. From the K-12th grades, I went to school in the Kent School District. From there, I attended Bellevue College, got my AS, and then transferred on over to UW. While I was studying, I worked as a tutor, both for group and private. Afterwards, I moved on to work as a Data Analyst. Throughout all of this, I was enjoying my hobby of playing games, and that is where I found my love for coding. Many games demand the user to complete very repetitive tasks: Kill X amount of monsters, collect X amount of vegetables, etc. Being the human that I am, I hated these tasks and wanted to find a different solution to simply completing each task manually. The first answer I came across were automation programs that could repeatedly do very simple actions for me. That simplicity proved not enough for me; I wanted to play the game by not playing the game. So, I looked into scripting, screen grabbing, image recognition, the works. Python was the answer I kept finding, but I had no idea how to code. I dove in, though, and through excessive googling and copying code snippets, I found myself enjoying the coding process more than playing the games I was doing all of this for. Automating a game was my way of beating the game. Now here I am, at Code Fellows, trying to learn more so that I can hopefully have a future doing what I love.</p>
